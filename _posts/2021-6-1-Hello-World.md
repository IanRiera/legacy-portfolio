I am a Telecommunication engineer and Master's student in Computer Vision at UAB (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona), in a [program](https://pagines.uab.cat/mcv/) that has been designed jointly with UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya), UPF (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) and UOC (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya). I am currently completing my Master Thesis as an internship at [Beamagine S.L.](https://beamagine.com/) in collaboration with the [Image Processing Group](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/) from UPC. The thesis focuses on pedestrian detection on point clouds obtained with the company's Lidar.
